# Train-Scheduler

What the project does: Train scheduler incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Get started by filling out the form with your desired train information and watch as it populates on the board. Questions with this app? Please message me on my Portfolio Contact Page, and I will get back to you!

I am the sole contributor of this project.
